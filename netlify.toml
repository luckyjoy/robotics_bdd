[build]
Defines the starting directory for the build process (repository root).

base = "."
The build command runs the Python script to prepare the reports.
Then, it creates a 'dist' folder and copies the final assets (index, redirects, reports) for deployment.

command = "rm -rf .netlify/cache && python run_docker.py 100 && mkdir -p dist && cp index.html dist/ && cp _redirects dist/ && cp -r reports dist/"
This specifies that ONLY the contents of 'dist' will be deployed publicly.

publish = "dist"

[functions]
Defines the directory for serverless functions, if used.

directory = "netlify/functions"
