    "Core Functional Requirement validation (e.g., Data Persistence, Transaction Processing, API Endpoints).",
    "System Integration testing across critical component interfaces (e.g., Microservices, Device Drivers).",
    "Non-Functional validation (e.g., Latency, Throughput, Resource Usage).",
    "Security feature verification (e.g., Authentication, Encryption, Access Control)."

  "Objective": "To rigorously validate the system's compliance with all documented functional and non-functional requirements under specified operating conditions.",
  "Scope": {
    "InScope": [
      "Functional Verification (REQ_FUN_XXX): Core business logic and use cases.",
      "Performance Testing (REQ_PER_XXX): Stress, load, and scalability benchmarks.",

  "Challenges": [
    "Maintaining stable and consistent test data synchronization across environments.",
    "Ensuring the test environment accurately reflects the production/deployment state.",
    "Integrating comprehensive reporting seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines.",
    "Handling asynchronous operations and complex state validation during testing."
  ],
  "TestPurposes": [
    "Verify system behavior against Gherkin/specification documentation.",
    "Automate the full regression suite for every code commit.",

    "Automated functional test execution across supported platforms.",
    "Dynamic scenario execution using data-driven testing (Scenario Outlines).",
    "System state management (setup, teardown, reset).",
    "Real-time logging and status reporting."
  ],
  "Limitations": [
    "Relies on external test harnesses or virtual environments for fault injection.",
    "Performance load generation limits determined by host machine capacity.",
    "Requires stable connectivity to external services or hardware interfaces."
